# About

Developer holds no responsibility with what people decide to do with this app. It was developed strictly for demonstration purposes only.
Developed under the following conditions:

- Visual Studio 2022 (17.6.5)
- v4.8.0 .NET Framework
- C# language

<br />

This generator has been developed to work on the following versions:
- WinRAR 6.x
- WinRAR 7.x

<br />

# Usage

If you wish to simply use the keygen, head over to the [Releases](https://github.com/Aetherinox/WinrarKeygen/releases) section and download the latest binary as a `zip` or `rar`. The download is a single `exe`.

- `WinrarKG.exe`

<br />

---

<br />

# Build

Download the source files and launch the `.csproj` project file in Visual Studio.

If you decide to modify or re-build my code, you are to not re-distribute. Unlike a lot of keygens, my files are free of malware, and I do not want people taking advantage of a quick solution that you can dump your non-sense malware into and re-distribute.

If you're looking to do a quick credits swap and re-distribute just so you can make a name for yourself; I'd highly recommend you actually learn C# and make something yourself.

# Signed Releases

As of `v1.0.0.0` and onwards, binaries are GPG signed with the key `CB5C4C30CD0D4028`. You can find the key available on most keyservers:

- [pgp.mit.edu](https://pgp.mit.edu/)
- [keyserver.ubuntu.com](keyserver.ubuntu.com)
- [keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org)

Binaries are also signed with a certificate which has the serial number `10d43e641e59fa884c773add600159dd`. If you downloaded this elsewhere on the internet and the binary is not signed with that certificate serial number; **IT IS NOT MINE**. You should delete it.

# Virus Scans

Unfortunately, virus scanners such as VirusTotal can report false positives. There's not much control I have over that. These websites will also attempt to detect keygens; sometimes you can get by it, and sometimes you can't.

Since this is a keygen, VirusTotal did indeed pick up on that and rated my script +2. Between versions 1.0 and 1.1, I've managed to remove some false positives, but Malwarebytes is still yelling about it being "fishy". You can review the results below. However, if you review the source code; obviously there's nothing at all which represents malware or a virus.

The only option I'd have is to contact these websites and tell them that it's a false positive, but I'm writing a keygen; I highly doubt they're going to be happy with doing anything.

I scanned with Windows Defender and it reported that the files are clean.
